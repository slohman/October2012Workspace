<string name="usembassydescr">"U.S. consular officers assist Americans who encounter serious
legal, medical, or financial difficulties. Although consular officers
cannot act as your legal counsel or representative, they can
provide the names of local attorneys and doctors, provide loans
to destitute Americans, and provide information about dangerous
conditions affecting your overseas travel or residence. Most
embassies and consulates have web sites with more information
and can be located from this link:
<b>http://usembassy.state.gov</b>
Travel registration is a free service provided by the U.S.
government to U.S. citizens who are traveling to, or living in, a
foreign country. Registration allows you to record information
about your up-coming trip abroad that the Department of State
can use to assist you in case of an emergency. Americans
residing abroad can also get information from the nearest U.S.
embassy or consulate. More information at the following link:
http://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs              


IF AN AFTER-HOURS NUMBER IS NOT SPECIFICALLY SHOWN, CALL THE
LISTED PHONE NUMBER AND ASK FOR THE EMBASSY DUTY OFFICER.
ALTERNATIVELY, CALL 1-202-501-444 (US) FROM OVERSEAS
TO REACH AN OVERSEAS CITIZEN SERVICES OPERATOR."</string>

<string name="two"><b>EIGHT POINTS YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO FORGET</b>
1.<b> Do not volunteer statements to anyone</b>, including
FedEx, FAA, or NTSB until you consult with ALPA FDX
MEC Representation. Never surrender your certificate to
any investigator.
2. <b>Immediately ensure hospitalization and/or medical
treatment for crew and jumpseaters.</b>
3.<b> Notify the MEC by calling (888) 882-4911* or (901)
752-8749. Notify FedEx by calling (901) 397-8040.
4. Engage an ALPA attorney as soon as possible.</b>
5. In a foreign country,<b> ensure compliance with their
laws;</b> ask that FedEx and the U.S. Embassy be notified.
Ask for an interpreter and an attorney.
6.<b>Submit to drug/alcohol tests as requested by FedEx
and authorized law enforcement agencies.</b> Federal
regulations require that the employer may be required to
test for drugs and/or alcohol. With MEC representation,
ensure that you comply with the regulations.
7. <b>Do no consume any alcohol or non-prescription
medications.</b> If you need prescription medications, ensure
you have a witness.
8. <b>Remember NO STATEMENTS, NO ALCOHOL,
and only medical attention need be in a hurry.</b>

<string name="three">IN CASE OF ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT
BE PREPARED! The “It will never happen to me” syndrome has
repeatedly been shown as flawed in the harsh world of risk
involvement, where an accident or incident is always a possibility.
Therefore, the FDX MEC’s Accident Investigation Committee
endorses the following guidelines for crewmembers who become
involved in an accident or incident.</string>


<string name="one">*** Accident Hotline Numbers Are Not For Contract Issues***
FDX MEC ACCIDENT/INCIDENT HOTLINE*
(888) 882-4911 *(MAY BE DISCONTINUED IN 2010)
INTERNATIONAL CALL (901) 752-8749
ALPA WORLDWIDE ACCIDENT/INCIDENT HOTLINE
(202) 797-4180 (PRIMARY)
(703) 892-4180 (SECONDARY)</string>


<string name="four">IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT
1. Contact the ALPA FDX MEC - As soon as you are assured
the immediate needs of your fellow crewmembers are being met,
call the MEC immediately on the accident/incident hotline and
relay the following information:

Your name
Accident Location
Approximate Date and time of the accident
Aircraft Type
Number of injuries and fatalities, if any
Extent of aircraft damage (major, minor, hull loss)
General description of accident (phase of flight, etc.)
Weather conditions at accident location
Names of crewmembers
Phone contact at accident location

Also report the accident to FedEx at (901) 397-8040. The sooner
the MEC is brought into the loop, the better support it can provide.
Any delay can really hurt later. All too often, what starts out as a
minor incident that lulls the crew into believing no help is
necessary suddenly blows up into a major event. The MEC then
gets a late call and must play a catch-up game.
2. It is best if you secure MEC representation immediately as
there may be a potential for discipline. An ALPA attorney will be in
contact with you to counsel you on the situational requirements
prior to your talking to management.
*If pressed for a statement or to be interviewed by the NTSB,
FAA, or others, tell them you will make a statement after
consultation with your MEC representative. If a safety of flight
item needs correcting immediately, you can, of course, mention
it - and stop right there until you have representation.

*NEVER make a statement to the press.

Your MEC
representative will handle press requests.
3. Keep your crew together and obtain rest facilities away
from the airport for all crewmembers. If there are any fatalities,
with the resultant media attention, one option available is to check
into the nearest hospital. Tell the medical personnel of your
situation and your desire to get some rest. Specify those persons
whom you want to see (including ALPA representatives), and ask
that no other visitors be allowed to see you.
4. Contact your family if you wish, but do not automatically
invite them to the scene or discuss the specifics of the
accident/incident with them. Advise them that the ALPA FDX MEC
will send someone to help them. If you feel that the news media
or others will bother your family, the telephone company can install
a temporary phone line for their private use until things quiet
down.
5. If possible, get the names, addresses, and telephone
numbers of jumpseaters and make copies of all documents
relating to your flight and retain them for your use only. These can
prove invaluable when you are trying to reconstruct the various
aspects of your flight. Remember: A hastily written statement
initially designed to help you can be taken out of context and
introduced as evidence against you at a future date.
6. Prepare all written statements with the help of an ALPA
attorney. You may be required to provide the Company and
federal authorities with a written statement within a specified time.
The MEC will advise you regarding their requests.
7. Regardless of the circumstances, the crew nearly always
suffers some post-accident or post-incident trauma. There is
always a qualified critical response team specifically formed to
assist with these issues, and help is available. All you have to do
is ask the MEC or ALPA for it.
8. Regarding incidents only - Remember to file a NASA
ASRS report (even if the event if classified as an incident) within
10 days. Send it registered mail and retain the receipt ASRS
sends back to you. The burden of proof that you filed an ASRS
report rests with you. Once ASRS de-identifies a report, not even
NASA can provide you with a copy. DO NOT send a NASA report
if in an accident until speaking with an MEC attorney.
</string>

<string name="five">InterView Guidelines
1. Never talk to a federal inspector or agent without an MEC
representative present.
2. Always tell the truth - it is the most powerful weapon you have.
3. Keep your answers short and to the point. Remember the ageold
adage: “If they ask what time it is, don’t build them a clock.” If
you find yourself saying, “I think...” you are already in trouble. Stick
to the facts.
4. DO NOT SURRENDER your certificate to a federal inspector. A
formal set of procedures must be followed before you are required
to relinquish your certificate. A copy of your certificate may be
provided and allowing the inspector to look at your certificate is
okay; you may want to specify that you are not surrendering your
certificate when the inspector wants to look at it.
